# Lab2_AI
After learning about Github and GitLLab, this lab is for the hands on experience for using both

**In the following code attched to the repository, we do the below acions:**

Loads the dataset from the file "wdbc.data".
Preprocesses the data by separating features (X) and labels (y).
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets using a 80-20 split.
Performs feature scaling on the training and testing sets.
Builds a logistic regression model and trains it using the training data.
Makes predictions on the testing set.
Evaluates the model using accuracy score and classification report.
